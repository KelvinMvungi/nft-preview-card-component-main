## My process
Created an empty local repository then initialized it to github and added the challenge files. Started working with HTML and then the CSS. This challenge is done with only HTML5 and CSS3 no additional libraries, preprocessors, frameworks.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt a lot especially in the styling with being able to set the overlay of the view image (it was pretty challenging).
